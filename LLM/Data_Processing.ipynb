If you are using this while you are going away for awhile and you are worried about a fish jumping, just put a piece of cardboard over the open part of the tank without blocking the feeder. Personally I had a small hole in the top of my hood and I placed the feeder right over the hole and it would drop right into the tank. 9 times out of 10 I would say you would be fine to leave the tank open with the feeder.\n",

      "Actual Assistant: Yes, it should help significantly, but I would make sure that water cannot get to it. A metal globe/shield around the socket would be advisable and make sure it is high enough the dog's back or head will not hit it. A better way to heat your dog house might be a heat mat, like used by green houses to heat seed trays. Again be that plugs are protected from water, such as a dog shaking the water out of his/her coat! You would be surprised at how much water a dog can shake off! If you use the mat, make sure to put a barrier to keep it away from your dog's teeth, so they will not chew it. I suggest using a piece of cement backer board you can get at Lowe's or Home Depot, and a masonry cutting blade for your circular saw to cut it. Cut the backer board to fit inside your dog's house and place it on top of the heat mat, then put bedding on top if the backer board. It will keep him/her nice and warm. You can even put a thermostat in there to keep it from getting too warm. Most heat matts can reach temps of 100 degrees, which will not burn the dog, but may make it too warm to sleep on! Hope this helps. Again the lamp will work, but be sure it is protected from any water exposure, as it could be dangerous to your dog, if close enough to touch, beside throwing a breaker and destroying the lamp (ceramic heat element).\n",

The box on this model, would probably be a bit too cumbersome for a very small dog. You might want to check with local dealers, such as pet stores and Farm Equipment store to find the smallest (yet effective) model, that you can. Then, see if you can find it for a less expensive price, online. In the -online- ads, under \"Specifications\", you should find the \"size\" of the box that holds the electronics. You must also consider the length and thickness of you dogs coat, to see if the electrodes will touch the skin, through the coat. Many models come with two different size/shape electrodes to suit your needs. My Jack, has a short, but very thick coat. So, a short, blunt ended electrode works for him.\n",

      "User: what is the flap size?\n",
      "Actual Assistant: that door is 15 x 20 and its the one I have leaving my patio. I would never have one like that placed on a door to the house. it is not too weather proof or insect proof and does not seal too well. as far as my home door, I used a dog mate large which I also ordered from amazon and it has a hard plastic insulated door which seals well. its large size(which I believe is the biggest they sell) is 11 3/4 by 14 but meets the needs of the average large dog. my shepherd stands 27 inches tall at mid back and weighs 93 pounds and uses it with no problem. if this door is leaving your home and not patio I would check into the dog mate door. also I installed it with lower opening approx. 9 1/2 inches from bottom of door. the dog mate doors will usually last for years. hope this helped\n",
